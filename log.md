# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 4: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed navigation bar, there was an issue with not correctly enabling jQuery or bootstrap.js correctly on                       codepen. Used bootstrap grid to create a portfolio gallery to put projects as they are completed.

**Thoughts:** I found the navigation bar difficult, but managed to get help from FCC gitter groups. Once I found out that the columns had to add to 12, I managed to complete the gallery section. Quite proud with my progress on this portfolio project. Need to work on using CSS without the aid of bootstrap (or at the very least, with reduced use). Next up on FCC is javascript so I will be able to start including my own scripts in my webpages at some point in the near future.
