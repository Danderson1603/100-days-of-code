# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 6: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had a lot of major issues with internet connection today. I worked a bit on my Portfolio site, mostly tidying up the code. Did some more of the javascript curriculum on FCC - focussing on functions. Created a repository to store all of the challenges or projects I complete as part of teaching myself to code. 

**Thoughts:** Even though I've had internet issues most of the day, I managed to get quite a lot done. I read up on the design process of website to give me a better overview of the design processes involved. Also enjoyed tidying up the code from my portfolio; it looks much more presentable now. I am getting used to the syntax involved in javascript now and am almost ready to start developing my own functions for use in websites or other projects.

###Day 5: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Migrated portfolio from codepen.io to github. Launched site which will updated periodically. Started the fCC's javascript curriculum. 

**Thoughts:** Found Javascript more difficult ot pick up than HTML/CSS. I'm persevering though, because I know that this will allow me to create more dynamic websites. I'm going to have to work out how to use FTP servers to make updating my website easier. For now, I'll keep it updated on github and push the updates live approximately once a week, to keep my portfolio relatively up to date.

Tomorrow I will do more on Javascript and find any small projects I can start to work on for this. I will also start to write some more content for my portfolio (http://dandersoncodes.com/).

###Day 4: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed navigation bar, there was an issue with not correctly enabling jQuery or bootstrap.js correctly on                       codepen. Used bootstrap grid to create a portfolio gallery to put projects as they are completed.

**Thoughts:** I found the navigation bar difficult, but managed to get help from FCC gitter groups. Once I found out that the columns had to add to 12, I managed to complete the gallery section. Quite proud with my progress on this portfolio project. Need to work on using CSS without the aid of bootstrap (or at the very least, with reduced use). Next up on FCC is javascript so I will be able to start including my own scripts in my webpages at some point in the near future.
